COVID-19 Data Analysis
The purpose of this science gateway will be to catalog the vaccinated counties of Illinois and to identify areas where progress on vaccinations is being made. The questions we asked ourselves to help us organize our data were:
1.     How do the vaccination rates of Illinois counties compare with each other?
2.     Are there similarities in how larger areas (combinations of county regions) receive COVID-19 vaccinations?
3.     Is there a plateau on vaccination rate? If so, when did it begin to occur?
 
We utilized data found at
·      https://www.dph.illinois.gov/covid19/vaccinedata?county=Illinois 
·      https://idph.illinois.gov/DPHPublicInformation/api/COVIDExport/GetVaccineAdministration?countyname=.

Using these questions, we looked for variables in the data that we wanted to investigate further. We created a graph that compares the number of vaccines administered in Illinois counties and the persons fully vaccinated. As the graph demonstrates a lot of people were getting vaccinated between March and May, but it has slowly started to plateau in June. More data is being collected on individual counties and if the vaccination rate stareted to plateau around the same time period.
 
The map shows the areas where vaccination rates are growing. After observing the data and organizing it into a graph and map, we can see that only about 50% of people are vaccinated within the state of Illinois. Vaccination rates were greatly increasing between March and May, but they are starting to plateau now in June and July. Regarding the map, our team looks to make distinctions with the color of certain portions of land to distinguish between different percentages of those vaccinated within Illinois counties.
 
This data is important because Illinois needs to continue to increase its vaccination rates so more people can stay healthy. With more people getting vaccinated we can continue to re-open safely and hopefully one day return back to normal life.
